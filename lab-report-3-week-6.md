## Description

By streamlining the ssh configuration, I can use the alias that I choose instead of the full username and server name in commands. For example, if I set the alias to ieng6, I can run `$ssh ieng6`, which would have the same result as running `$ ssh cs15lsp22agj@ieng6.ucsd.edu`. This also works for scp and many other server related commands.
