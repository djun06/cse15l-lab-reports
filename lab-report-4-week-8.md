# Answers to the Questions

## Snippet 1

I do not believe that there is a small change that I could make to my code to cause the expected output for snippet 1. In order to cause the expected output for snippet 1, along with tracking the markdown for links, I will also have to track the markdown for anything using backticks which will require me to track the first backtick, track the second backtick, and check whether or not the backtick affects the link. This will likely take more than 10 lines of code.

## Snippet 2

I do not believe that there is a small change that I could make to my code to cause the expected output for snippet 2.

## Snippet 3
